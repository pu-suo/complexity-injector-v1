  <!--
    This offscreen document runs AI inference directly (not in a sub-worker).
    This is necessary because ONNX Runtime Web creates internal workers,
    and Chrome extensions block blob URL workers created from within workers.
    Running directly in the offscreen document (a regular page context) allows
    ONNX to create its workers normally.
